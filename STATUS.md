# STATUS — vamp (VAMP vs cuRobo benchmark)
Goal: Honest, reproducible VAMP vs cuRobo comparison on the cuRobo paper's problems (UR5e, 7th-axis gantry) plus VAMP's standard benchmarks; discharges the 2025-09-03 promise to Prof. Kavraki.
Finish line: results/*.json + one figure + README headline numbers + docs/EMAIL_NOTES.md + speedup-number (62x/50x/12x) reconciliation, all committed locally.
Deadline: none set (brief: $0, highest relationship value)
Milestone: V2-1 — benchmark v2 frozen (6aea6ee) and pre-registered; Panda sets selected (MBM 300, MpiNets 300; amendment A1 logged); held-out generation running; VAMP CPU step next
Last result: TOPP-RA/Ruckig cost measured before freeze: Ruckig P1 0.36 ms p50, TOPP-RA P2 17.6 ms p50 per path (results/v2/timing_cost.json)
Blocked: none. 62x/50x/12x: not in the paper (it says 60x, cited); origin of the brief's 62/50/12 unknown
Next: VAMP CPU step on held-out/MBM/MpiNets × 10 seeds -> exact GPU-hours under Blocked -> GPU slot (cuRobo v1 full, V2 subsample) -> pick-place MoveL sequence
